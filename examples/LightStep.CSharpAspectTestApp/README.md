# Tracing With Aspects

This is a small sample application demonstrating how to use an Aspect framework (such as PostSharp) to apply Tracing to methods.

## Installation and Setup

Set the `LS_KEY` environment variable to your project's API Key.

**Important**: This sample will only build on Windows platforms, as PostSharp does not support all CoreCLR targets for compilation.
